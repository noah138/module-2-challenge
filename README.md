# My Portfolio

This intention of this project was to build an online portfolio for potential employers that shows off my deployed work samples. To create an effective online portfolio, I created a page that included links to my previous work and to ways to contact me. I presented the previous works in an aesthetic grid layout. In addition, this project asked for a responsive layout that adapted from large to medium to small viewports. Using flexbox, I matched my webpage with the layouts shown in the mock design through laptop and phone viewports.

Large viewport:
